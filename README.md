In this project, we used 6 different machine learning algorithms to predict finacial restatements.
The data sets are from TR EIKON and Audit Analytics. So the project consists of 2 parts.

The first part is for data set from TR EIKON:

1. Run restatements.py to get restatements for each firm-year.

2. Run testdatei.py to get data for each firm-year.

3. Run testdateimitlabels.py to combine the restatements and data.

4. Run 6 different algorithms with or without FeatureBoost. These 6 algorithms are in AdaBoost_Mit_FeatureBoost.py, AdaBoost_Ohne_FeatureBoost.py,
DecisionTree_Mit_FeatureBoost.py, DecisionTree_Ohne_FeatureBoost.py, IsolationForest_Mit_FeatureBoost.py, IsolationForest_Ohne_featureBoost.py,
Knn_Mit_FeatureBoost.py, Knn_Ohne_FeatureBoost.py, Randomforest_Mit_FeatureBoost.py, Randomforest_Ohne_FeatureBoost.py,
Svm_Mit_FeatureBoost.py, Svm_Ohne_FeatureBoost.py.

The second part is for data set from Audic Analytics:

1. Run dataset_audit_analytics.py to combine the restatements from Audit Analytics and the data from TR EIKON. After running this programï¼Œwe
got three csv files. One for label "positive", one for label "negative" and one for label "negative or positive".

2. Run negative_Mit_FeatureBoost.py, negative_Ohne_FeatureBoost.py, svm_negative_Mit_FeatureBoost.py and svm_negative_Ohne_FeatureBoost.py to 
analyse the performance of 6 algorithms regarding "negative". SVM runs separately from other algorithms because svm runs too slowly and needs to be run by HPC.

3. Run positive_Mit_FeatureBoost.py, positive_Ohne_FeatureBoost.py, svm_positive_Mit_FeatureBoost.py and svm_positive_Ohne_FeatureBoost.py to 
analyse the performance of 6 algorithms regarding "positive". SVM runs separately from other algorithms because svm runs too slowly and needs to be run by HPC.

4. Run positive_or_negative_Mit_FeatureBoost.py, positive_or_negative_Ohne_FeatureBoost.py, svm_po_ne_Mit_FeatureBoost.py and svm_po_ne_Ohne_FeatureBoost.py to 
analyse the performance of 6 algorithms regarding "negative or positive". SVM runs separately from other algorithms because svm runs too slowly and needs to be run by HPC.
